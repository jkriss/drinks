It's pretty delicious.

- 2 oz gin
- 1/2 oz lemon juice
- 1/3 oz Maraschino liqueur
- 1/6 oz Creme de Violette

Shake, garnish with cherry.

Particularly tasy with with [Ransom](http://www.ransomspirits.com/) [Old Tom Gin](http://www.36thavewine.com/spirits/Old-Tom-Ransom-Gin-w2607138r6), although it muddies the color a bit.
